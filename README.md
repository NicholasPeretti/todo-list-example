# React Todo List
This is a simple implementation of a todo list in ReactJS. It's meant to be just a sample to learn how ReactJS works.

## Installation
First of all clone this Repository and install the dependecies
```
git clone https://github.com/NicholasPeretti/todo-list-example.git
cd todo-list-example
yarn
```
If you want to see the final result just
```
yarn start
```

If you want to try to change the code you can go back in the history to the `Barebone vesion` commit. It's the second commit.

```
git checkout 38434cb8af0b2206b018a98243f3fd78a8acd824
```
It will provide a basic todo list application with very simple code to understand and edit.
